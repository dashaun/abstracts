# Cloud Native Spring for Relational Databases

## Abstract
 
Traditionally spring framework has been popular with accessing RDBMS databases
for its compressive transaction support and declarative way of executing transactions compared to EJBs.
As enterprises embrace cloud-native architecture,
Spring Data projects have been very popular for implementing data access APIs in spring microservices,
partly due to the consistent abstractions provided by spring data irrespective of SQL dialects.

In this talk, DaShaun will walk you through current state of Spring Data support
for building scalable and resilient cloud native microservices using modern relational databases.
