# My children will never deploy active-passive

Is your app alone and trembling in a dark, single-region with failures, latency, and retry storms closing in on every side?

In this session, you will learn a reference architecture, for modern, geo-distributed applications.
You will learn how to modernize a single-region application, into a multiple-region or multi-cloud architecture.
You will help decide which of the regions to destroy, during a live demonstration, of a reference implementation.
By the end of this interactive session, your apps will be able to shine bright with confidence, resiliency, and no more trembling.
