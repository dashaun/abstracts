# My children will never deploy active-passive

Is your app alone and trembling in a dark single region with failures, latency, and retry storms closing in on every side?

Build a Spring Boot app with Spring Data Redis, then deploy it to a single region backed by Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise (ACRE). Add a global load balancer like Azure Front Door. Deploy the same application to multiple regions, backed my multiple instances of ACRE connected in active-active configuration. Learn why connecting to data in a different region is an anti-pattern. Destroy an entire region to see the value of active-active level resilience using Terraform, Spring Boot, and Azure.

In this session, you will learn a reference architecture for modern, geo-distributed applications. You'll also learn how to modernize a single-region application into a multiple-region or multi-cloud architecture. By the end of this interactive session, your apps will be able to shine bright with confidence, resiliency, and no more trembling.
