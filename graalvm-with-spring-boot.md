# GraalVM with Spring Boot

Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 imply a new baseline. They will bring the Spring ecosystem in line with the needs of tomorrow's workloads. Spring Native provides support for compiling Spring applications to native executables using GraalVM.  

Native images can provide cheaper, more sustainable delivery for a range of workloads. These include microservices, function workloads, well suited to containers, and Kubernetes.

In this session, we will look at the GraalVM AOT compiler.
We will produce native images with smaller footprints and faster startup times.
We will test containerized native images and optionally, use the cloud to power the native image worklflow.
