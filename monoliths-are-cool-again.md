# Streamline Your Delivery Pipeline with Spring Modulith - Monoliths are cool again!

Are you tired of building software supply chains and infrastructure, for dozens of microservices, before the product has even reached MVP?
Are you tired of wrestling with fragile monoliths?
Spring Modulith offers a happy medium, enabling you to build modular applications that deploy faster and scale easier.
This session dives deep into Spring Modulith's capabilities, specifically designed to streamline your DevOps workflow.

What You'll Learn:

- Modularize Your Spring Boot Applications: Discover how to decompose your monolith into loosely coupled modules for independent development, deployment, and scaling.
- Automate Testing and Validation: Leverage Spring Modulith's built-in tools to enforce structural consistency and ensure seamless inter-module communication.
- Boost Collaboration and Maintainability: Improve code clarity and project ownership with clear module boundaries and automated documentation.
- Monitor Module Interactions in Real-Time: Gain valuable insights into application behavior with live visibility into module communication.
- Live Coding Demonstration: See Spring Modulith in action as we walk through a real-world scenario, showcasing its practical application for efficient deployments and streamlined operations.

Deleted code yields no bugs.
The "fallacies of distributed systems" should be more popular.
Monoliths are cool again.

This session is perfect for DevOps engineers and practitioners seeking to optimize delivery pipelines and enhance the maintainability of Spring Boot (or any) applications.
