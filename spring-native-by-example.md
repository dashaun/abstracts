# Spring Native By Example

Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 imply a new baseline. They will bring the Spring ecosystem in line with the needs of tomorrow's workloads. Spring Native provides support for compiling Spring applications to native executables using GraalVM.

We'll look at the GraalVM AOT compiler. We will produce native images with smaller footprints and faster startup times. We'll look at how to containerize those workloads. We'll look at how to tame the GraalVM compiler when something goes wrong. And we'll look at how to teach GraalVM about your custom workloads.

Explore how Spring Native delivers valuable outcomes, today.
