# Spring Boot Observability

## Abstract

The best person to create observability for your application is you.
Going from reactive monitoring and alerting to proactive observability enables us to deliver our apps with confidence.
Make yourself, the business, SRE, and ops teams happy, by delivering observability, with your code, to production.

In this session, the presenter discusses:

- Thinking about observability before going to production
- Getting started with metrics and the Spring Boot actuator
- Explore using Micrometer for custom metrics
- Using Sleuth and the benefits of tracing in distributed systems
- Demonstrate Spring Boot integration with Wavefront

This will be a combination of abstract discussion and live coding demonstrations.
We will develop an application, push it to production with a meaningful dashboard and observability.
