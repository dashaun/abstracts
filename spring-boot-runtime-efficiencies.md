Spring Boot 3 introduces a suite of features designed to enhance runtime performance and optimize resource usage. In this talk, we’ll explore the key innovations in this release that help developers build faster, more efficient applications. We'll begin with Ahead-of-Time (AOT) processing, which accelerates startup times by precomputing application configurations, followed by Class Data Sharing (CDS), which reduces memory usage by allowing JVM processes to share class metadata.

We’ll dive into GraalVM native images, highlighting how they drastically improve startup performance and memory consumption, making them ideal for modern cloud-native applications. We’ll also cover Project CRAC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint), a game-changer for reducing startup times in containerized environments by allowing JVM applications to be suspended and restored with minimal overhead.

Finally, we'll wrap up with the integration of Java 21's virtual threads, a revolutionary improvement in how Spring Boot handles high-concurrency tasks, greatly enhancing scalability and efficiency. Through live demos, you'll learn how to leverage these tools and techniques to optimize your Spring Boot applications for maximum runtime performance.
