# 15-Factor on K8s

Perhaps you have heard of 12-factor apps, cloud-native, or 15-factor apps.
Maybe you have wondered if cloud-native was right for you.
In this session we will explore how to deliver apps using this methodology on k8s.
We will start by explaining the 15-factors.
We will also review the cloud native features that are built into k8s.
Then we will create a new application, for k8s, and demonstrate how to make it 15-factor-cloud-native-on-k8s!
