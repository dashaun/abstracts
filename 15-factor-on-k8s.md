Are you ready to elevate your application development skills?
Immerse yourself in our interactive session where we dive into the realm of 15-factor, cloud-native applications
using Spring Boot and Kubernetes.
We start by dissecting the 15 factors and then guide you on how to harness Kubernetes' built-in cloud-native features.
We will construct new Spring Boot applications from the ground up,
demonstrating "better" practices along the way.
You will gain hands-on experience with observability, testing, security, and inner-loop development,
all while enjoying the amazing developer experience Spring Boot provides.
Lastly, we'll walk through documenting, debugging, maintaining, and containerizing your applications
to make them truly 'bootiful', 15-factor, cloud-native, and ready for deployment on Kubernetes.
Don't miss this opportunity to enhance your development skills and stay ahead of the curve.
