= Meaningful Metrics

== Abstract

If you get excited about delivering value, in production, this session is for you.

It has become increasingly difficult to determine business value using only traditional metrics like response time, CPU, and memory usage.

In this session, we will explore how to measure business value by leveraging Micrometer metrics.

We will start by explaining some of the core concepts of metrics collection.

We will discuss both greenfield and brownfield use cases.

(Spoiler alert, you don't need to measure everything!)           

Finally, we will push some code to production and observe our application using common monitoring systems.

Being in production is great, being in production with meaningful metrics is even better!
